These files are used to obtain the PDBBind data from deepchem's AWS. This dataset reports labels in the form log(Kd/Ki), and is used in deepchem's Atomic Convolutions. 123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFTo obtain the datasets:123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF1) Run get_pdbbind.sh. This will download the database from the server in folder "datasets". (copied from deepchem github)123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF2) Run extract_pdbbind.py. This will save the datasets in numpy arrays that contain the data necessary for the Atomic Convolutions (ligand, receptor, and complex -- coords, neighbor indices, neighbor atom types, and elements). 123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF	- Note that you can change the atom_dictionary if you want to change the atom type representation.123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF	- To train on a different dataset (currently defaults to random split for the refined dataset), simply change the path variables accordingly. 123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF	- utils.py contains many utility functions/classes used in extract_pdbbind.py, in particular DiskDataset accesses the joblib file and gets data using .X, .y, .ids.
