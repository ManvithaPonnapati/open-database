# Sandbox

Sandbox is a place for different scripts/projects that can not be merged (yet) into the main tree. It also collects old scripts that might sometime be used again.


#### av4_vina_score
an active attempt to generate vina scores in python  

#### bond_rotation
an active attempt to do ligand conformation sampling in python

#### drug-shapematch
an active project to predict binding without considering protein/ligand rotations

#### IBM_net
code written by Ellen and Brian in one semester, referring to IBM's paper on analog of atomic convolutions (waiting to be merged)

#### shapes_fc_simple
a toy shape-matching example, serving as the inspiration for the **drug-shapematch** project

<br />

#### Other scripts
##### auc_script.py
calculate AUC for DUD-E docking data based on the solutions file.  
##### AutoDock_autogrid
old script written by Yi to write autogrids to a CSV file + some other preprocessing scripts (not tested)  
##### protein_sequence_clustering
an old script written by Yi that clusters proteins based on their sequence
##### vmd_ligand_protein.py
fragment of an old script written by Nilai to visualize input atoms of the protein and ligand
##### av3_generate
a very old piece of code Xiao wrote to rotate and translate ligands
##### av4_cost_functions
a very old script written by Mina for exploring which cost functions may give better sorting, compared to cross entropy
