# Affinity Core V3123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFAffinity core is a starting code for training deep convolutional neural networks on crystallographic images of proteins to predict drug binding. In the simplest case, the training set consists of two folders of co-crystal structures of proteins and small molecules labeled either 0 or 1 (binders and decoys). Network can be trained to distinguish between these two classes when given an uknown 3D structure of the complex in the future.123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF# scripts:123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFav3_database_master.py 123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFis used to crawl and index the directoris, parse protein structures (PDB files) into numpy arrays with 4 columns. The first three columns store the coordinate of the atoms, fourth column stores an atom tag (float) corresponding to a particular element. Chemical Element to atom hashtable is stored in av3_atomdict.py 123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF
