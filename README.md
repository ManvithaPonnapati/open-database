# Affinity Core V3123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFAffinity core is a starting code for training deep convolutional neural networks on crystallographic images of proteins to predict drug binding. In the simplest case, the training set consists of two folders of co-crystal structures of proteins and small molecules labeled either 0 or 1 (binders and decoys). Network can be trained to distinguish between those two classes when given an uknown 3D structure of the complex in the future.123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF# scripts:123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFav3_database_master.py 123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFcrawls and indexes directoris, parses protein structures (PDB files) into numpy arrays with 4 columns. The first three columns store coordinates of all atoms, fourth column stores an atom tag (float) corresponding to a particular element. Hashtable to determine the correspondence between chemical elements and numbers is sourced from av3_atomdict.py123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF
