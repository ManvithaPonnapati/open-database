# Deep learning on protein images123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFFirst application of deep convolutional neural networks for drug-protein interaction prediction has appeared [in the paper of AtomWise](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02855) when the small 3D AlexNets have been trained on atoms of drug-protein complexes. We have experimented with the network structure and obtained predictions of a very high accuracy.123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF![alt tag](https://github.com/mitaffinity/core/blob/master/misc/alexnet.jpg)123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF**Fig1:** AlexNet as it was described in: [Krizhevsky et al.](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks)  123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF![alt tag](https://github.com/mitaffinity/core/blob/master/misc/netvision_cool.jpg)123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF**Fig2:** Network Vision. To represent input to the network, coordinates of atoms determined by crystallographers have to be converted to an image made of cubic pixels. Since on a small scale the world is very sparse, approximately 1 real-valued pixel in 10^7 zeros, an approximation has to be made. In our case every atom is assigned a numeric tag that fills the value of the cubic pixel with the size of 0.5A. This picture depicts the structure of an aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase - an enzyme important for nucleic acids metabolism with the substrate in it's binding site. Image of protein have been rendered in VMD in a form common for scientific literature. Small differently colored spheres represent an approximation of atomc coordinates that the network sees. 123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFHere we provide a working example of the code that distinguishes correct docked positions of ligands from incorrect with an AUC of 0.934. 123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFAfter a few hours of training network visualization in tensorboard might look [like this](http://ec2-54-244-199-10.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/)123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF(in google chrome browser)123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF### scripts:123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF**database_master** [av3_database_master.py](./av3_database_master.py)123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFcrawls and indexes directoris, parses protein and ligand structures (.pdb files) into numpy (.npy) arrays with 4 columns. The first three columns store the coordinates of all atoms, fourth column stores an atom tag (float) corresponding to a particular element.

Database master handles and captures errors in this case. After .npy arrays have been generated, database master creates label-ligand.npy-protein.npy trios and writes them into database_index.csv file. 123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFFinally, database master reads database_index.csv file, shuffles it, and safely splits the data into training and testing sets.123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF***av3*** [av3.py](./av3.py)123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNF123343DJNBFHJBJNKFJNBHDRFBNJKDJUNFthe main script.
